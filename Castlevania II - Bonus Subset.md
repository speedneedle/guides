<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Castlevania II</strong> is the black sheep of the original NES trilogy of Castlevania games, but it set the stage for some of the themes that the series began leaning on hard by the time Symphony of the Night was released in 1997. It’s a strange game with a poor translation, and sometimes the programming behind it is being held together with string and paperclips. Welcome to the <strong>Castlevania II Bonus Set</strong>, where cutting the strings and bending the paperclips will lead to 19 big time challenges for Simon Belmont professionals.</p>
<h2 id="set-design">Set Design</h2>
<p>This set was originally started by <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/Mutawarrior">Mutawarrior</a>, and then later greatly expanded on by <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/TheMysticalOne">TheMysticalOne</a>. There are 19 total achievements and range from seriously challenging to mildly absurd. Several of the achievements rely on some well-known tricks and glitches, most of which are not terribly difficult to pull off.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#fullgamechallenges">Full Game Challenges</a></strong> are a set of four achievements that require a full playthrough of the game with some easy to intermediate restrictions on how you play. These games require a start-to-finish gameplay session and ask you to collect items, change collection order, or simply don’t die ever.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#glitchshowcase">Glitch Showcase</a></strong> are two achievements that ask you to do some out of the ordinary things. These are tactics employed by speedrunners. You’ll have to learn how to pull them off if you wish to unlock them!</li>
<li><strong><a href="#thelonggrind">The Long Grind</a></strong> is a set of four achievements that ask you to accomplish tasks that might require you to stop and whip the same enemies over and over again, but for lots of very different reasons.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#damagelessmansions">Damageless Mansions</a></strong> is exactly what is sounds like - take on each of the five mansions in an attempt to procure the Body Part within and exit, all without ever being hurt. In some cases, Simon Belmont may need to use his ninja skills to walk through walls!</li>
<li><strong><a href="#lowchallenges">Low % Challenges</a></strong> are the final four achievements and insist on very difficult restrictions on a full game playthrough. You’ll have to make use of some tricks to surpass expectations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prologue---some-info-to-get-you-started">Prologue - Some Info to Get You Started</h2>
<a id="whipdamage">
</a><h3 id="subweapon-vs.-whip-damage-calculations">Subweapon vs. Whip Damage Calculations</h3>
<p>Without getting into a huge math equation, it’s best to remember that the base damage of many of Simon’s subweapons is actually governed by the <strong>current whip he’s holding</strong>. That means the amount of hits an enemy like Death takes from a weapon such as the Sacred Flame is directly correlated with the type of whip Simon is holding. Your experience level does not impact damage output - it only governs your total hit points and defense.</p>
<p>Using the Sacred Flame with the Leather Whip will take many more hits than using that same Sacred Flame with the Chain Whip. The amount of hits Dracula takes with most subweapons while the Leather Whip is equipped is monumental, and can make a famously easy battle much more difficult! When achievement restrictions don’t apply, it’s always beneficial to upgrade your whip - <a href="#nowhipping">even if you’re not allowed to use it!</a></p>
<hr>
<a id="floordrop">
</a><h3 id="floor-dropping">Floor Dropping</h3>
<p>A fairly easy to pull off glitch in Castlevania II allows Simon to drop through floors. In order to pull off this trick, Simon needs to be standing on a block that is two blocks higher than the floor you’re attempting to drop through. You may have even had this happen to you in a normal playthrough accidentally - but now you’ll learn how to execute it any time you like!</p>
<p>This is a frame perfect trick but can be attempted as many times as you’d like until you succeed. <strong>The goal is to drop off the side of the block you’re standing on while whipping simultaneously</strong>. If you’ve managed to succeed, Simon will drop off the block he’s standing on and then pass through the solid floor and land on whatever is below. If you don’t succeed at first, keep trying - you will eventually get it to work!</p>
<p>Pulling off this glitch is required for <a href="#devo">Devo Would be Proud</a>, which restricts the use of holy water to break blocks that impede your progress. It can also come in handy for some of the Damageless Mansion achievements by skipping through whole sections of dangerous hallways.</p>
<hr>
<a id="maxdamage">
</a><h3 id="subweapon-max-damage-glitch">Subweapon Max Damage Glitch</h3>
<p>There’s a pretty well known glitch in Castlevania II in which the damage of your thrown subweapon will increase to the maximum value (255 damage) if it registers a hit on the <strong>very last frame</strong> the subweapon is active. Doing damage of 255 is enough to destroy every enemy in the game with the exception of Dracula himself - and even then, it will take a huge chunk out of his total life.</p>
<p>This trick is most noticeable with the <strong>Holy Water</strong> (the frame in which the item hits the ground) and with the <strong>Dagger</strong> (the frame right before it disappears after traveling a set distance).</p>
<p>This trick will be necessary to complete <a href="#onehitdeath">Shot to the Heart and Simon’s to Blame</a>. It also comes in handy for achievements like <a href="#minimalist">Minimalist Law Abider</a> that allow you to use the Holy Water.</p>

<a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/68153">Fully Stocked Vampire Hunter (25)</a><br>
<em>Get to Dracula’s Castle fully stocked (all items and subweapons, 8 Laurels, 8 Garlic, Flame Whip, 256 Hearts)</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>This is essentially a 100% Completion run and it requires grabbing every single item in the game! This isn’t terribly difficult for someone with some experience finishing this game, but it can be time-consuming to refresh your Hearts over and over again. You’ll need to pick up the following, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy the <strong>Dagger</strong> for 50 Hearts in the town of Veros.</li>
<li>Get the <strong>Silver Knife</strong> by dropping Garlic in the Carmilla Cemetery, just east of the town of Aljiba.</li>
<li>Get the <strong>Golden Knife</strong> from defeating Death in Brahm’s Mansion.</li>
<li>Get the <strong>Cross</strong> buy defeating Carmilla in Laruba Mansion.</li>
<li>Buy the <strong>Holy Water</strong> for 50 Hearts in the town of Jova.</li>
<li>Obtain the <strong>Diamond</strong> from the old man by the cliff west of Brahm’s Mansion.</li>
<li>Obtain the <strong>Sacred Flame</strong> from the east side of Dabi’s Path, east of the town of Veros.</li>
<li>You’ll need to get the <strong>Three Colored Crystals</strong> throughout the game. You should have the <strong>Red Crystal</strong> by the time you enter the endgame.</li>
<li>Collect all five <strong>Body Parts</strong> from the five mansions.
<ul>
<li>Buy an extra <strong>Oak Stake</strong> for 50 Hearts after collecting all five Body Parts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the very least, buy the <strong>Morning Star</strong> for 200 Hearts in the Town of Ondol. This will overwrite any previous whip purchases, so the Thorn and Chain Whips are not required, although you may wish to purchase them to help push your progress through the game anyway.
<ul>
<li>Upgrade your Morning Star to the <strong>Flame Whip</strong> from the old man to the west of Bodley Mansion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grab the <strong>Silk Bag</strong> by dropping Garlic in the cemetery under Sadam Woods.
<ul>
<li>After obtaining the Silk Bag, max out your <strong>Garlic</strong> and <strong>Laurels</strong> by buying them at shops. A set of two costs 50 Hearts each. You’ll need eight of each.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After obtaining all of the above, grind out your <strong>Hearts</strong> back to 256.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve met every requirement on this list, enter Dracula’s Castle and the achievement will unlock!</p>

<a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/68154">Wealthy Vampire Killer (10)</a><br>
<em>Beat Dracula having 256 Hearts at Level 3 or less (no laurels)</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>There are three prerequisites for this achievement beyond finishing the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot be higher level than 3. This will impact your hit points and defense.</li>
<li>You cannot use Laurels during the Dracula fight to make yourself invincible.</li>
<li>You must finish the fight with 256 hearts, so no subweapons that use Hearts can be used, like the Golden Knife or the Sacred Flame.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these restrictions noted, it’s important to also note what is <strong>not</strong> restricted:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can upgrade your whip as much as you like. Understanding <a href="#whipdamage">how whip damage impacts the game</a> will allow you to mount a strong offense.</li>
<li>You can use subweapons that do <strong>not</strong> use hearts, like the Dagger and the Holy Water, and potentially <a href="#maxdamage">defeat Dracula really fast</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to stay at Level 3, keep tabs on your accrued experience. You will level up to 4 at 250 experience gained - if you get close, you can take an intentional Game Over to reset your experience gain to zero. As you progress through the game, areas that give you experience will stop giving you experience, making these earlier areas a great spot to grind Hearts without accidentally leveling up.</p>
<p>Come into the Dracula fight with a Flame Whip and 256 Hearts. You can either jump and whip him on the altar, or try to stun lock him with Holy Water or Daggers. In both cases, the amount of hits Dracula takes is severely reduced with the Flame Whip equipped. There should be very little chance of failure.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you are unable to complete the job and you hit a Game Over state, your Heart supply returns to zero when you continue. You’ll have to leave the castle and grind them back up again.</p>

<a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/68155">5-4-2-3-1 We’re Having Fun (50)</a><br>
<em>Beat the game getting Dracula’s parts in Ring, Nail, Heart, Eyeball, Rib order (no passwords)</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>This achievement asks you to complete the mansions in a nearly reverse order. This is not terribly hard, but requires some significant legwork at the beginning to set up properly. Unless you are proficient in pulling off the <a href="#blobboost">Blob Boost</a>, quite a bit of backtracking will be needed. This guide assumes you will not be performing that trick.</p>
<p>The twist in a run like this is that you’ll need to keep flipping around what color Crystal you have on hand to execute tasks in reverse order. The important thing to know is that <strong>buying a White Crystal will override whatever your current Crystal is</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Getting Started</strong> - There’s quite a bit of prep work you can do to get ready. You’ll want to buy <strong>Holy Water</strong> and the <strong>White Crystal</strong> to start. You’ll then need to head all the way east to trade for the <strong>Blue Crystal</strong> in Aljiba, then walk <em>all the way west</em> to Alba to trade for the <strong>Red Crystal</strong>. Keep heading west and buy a <strong>Morning Star</strong> in the town of Ondol. Grab any of the other optional items you’d like along the way - the <strong>Silk Bag</strong> maybe be a solid pick up as you’ll be walking through the marshes around Laruba Mansion a few times in this run.</li>
<li><strong>Laruba Mansion</strong> is first on the list. Use the Red Crystal west of Ondol, skip Bodley Mansion, and continue west. You can grab the <strong>Flame Whip</strong> on the way. Take some Laurels with you if you need them for the marsh, and grab the free Laurels from the old man in Laruba Mansion to get back out.</li>
<li><strong>Bodley Mansion</strong> is next. Backtrcking should not be a problem. It may still be easier to bring an extra Oak Stake from Laruba Mansion than trying to buy one here.</li>
<li><strong>Rover Mansion</strong> is the third on the list, and this will require a major crystal adjustment. You need to cross the marsh back to Laruba Mansion, pass it and head west across the second marsh, which will loop you back around to Aljiba. From here, keep going west until you’re back in the town of Jova. Buy a <strong>White Crystal</strong> and it will overwrite the Red Crystal you have. Now you’ve got to go back east - to Aljiba again - and trade your White Crystal for the <strong>Blue Crystal</strong> so you can kneel at the lake.</li>
<li>With <strong>Dracula’s Heart</strong> in hand you can now equip it to cross the lake to <strong>Brahm Mansion</strong>. On the way, you must buy another <strong>White Crystal</strong> - this is the third time - in the town of Jova.</li>
<li>Finally, you’ll head back east to <strong>Berkeley Mansion</strong> to collect the final Body Part. After finishing the task you’ll need to go back east to Aljiba yet again to trade for the <strong>Blue Crystal</strong>.</li>
<li>Proceed to the endgame as per usual, stopping to switch to the <strong>Red Crystal</strong> in Alba.</li>

<a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/68156">Simon Says Don’t Die (50)</a><br>
<em>Beat the game without losing a life (get the parts in the Rib, Heart, Eyeball, Nail, Ring order)</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>This achievement unlocks after you defeat Dracula, losing zero lives. There’s a similar achievement in the main set for beating the game with no continues - now you cannot die, not even once!</p>
<p>As you get better at Castlevania II, it will become apparent that monsters are generally not the true enemy of the deathless run. Jumping over pitfalls are the biggest issues, as slipping up on a poorly timed jump will end a deathless attempt immediately. Here are some extremely general tips on simplifying your experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re truly worried about death by damage, you can spend extra time grinding for experience. Raising your level will increase your hit points and your overall defense. By level 5 you’ll be a powerhouse, and by level 6 you’re be virtually invincible.</li>
<li>You can also buy lots of Laurels and run through portions of the game <em>literally</em> invincible. Bring those Laurels to get to Laruba Mansion, and remember that you can refill your stock from the old man west of Carmilla’s room.</li>
<li>There are two bridge areas in the game with jumps over water as Fish Men attack. The first one at the beginning of the game is not too hard, but the second one is much closer to Dracula’s Castle, just east of the town of Doina, and the Fish Men there are very aggressive. It may be worth your while to only attempt a crossing during the day. Equip the Rib to help block any projectiles.</li>
<li>Before the Diamond and Deborah’s Cliff (where you use the Red Crystal) are a series of blocks over water that move up and down. The trick to jumping on these is to only jump forward when the block is moving <strong>upwards</strong>. this will give Simon a very noticeable lift that allows him to cross these gaps with ease. Don’t worry about where the next block is, only concern yourself with the direction that the block you’re standing on is moving.</li>
<li>There are lots of two-block-high jumps over water in the game, most notably in Rover Mansion. You can cut those jumps in half in Rover buy bringing an Oak Stake from Berkeley Mansion. Speaking of Berkeley Mansion, there’s another one of these jumps right after you get off the White Crystal platform at the beginning.</li>
<li>Bring an extra Oak Stake from Brahm Mansion to Bodley Mansion to greatly reduce the legwork required to finish that mansion.</li>

<em>One-shot Death using the dagger.</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>If you haven’t reviewed the <a href="#maxdamage">Max Damage Glitch</a> yet, go read that section first, and the goal of this achievement will become much more apparent.</p>
<p>Equip the Dagger while on the screen just to the left of Death’s chamber. As you enter, jump into the air and toss a Dagger. If it hits Death <em>juuuuuust right</em>, it will take 255 damage and instantly vaporize. If Death does not die, simply walk back to the left screen to reset the fight and try again.</p>
<p>This might take you a handful of tries, but it’s surprisingly easy to pull off. Being able kill Death in one shot will help you get the Golden Knife easily for some of the more difficult achievements in this set.</p>

<a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/218214">Thanks for the Lift! (10)</a><br>
<em>Perform a blob boost then complete the wrong warp from Storigoi Graveyard to Joma Marsh.</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>The “Blob Boost” is a trick utilized mostly by speedrunners of this game to create a “Wrong Warp”, which in turn allows a player to access later areas of the game sooner than they normally should. The Blob Boost is tough to pull off, but can be attempted as many times as you’d like.</p>
<p>The trick is executed at the dead end of the cemetery underneath the <strong>Sadam Woods</strong> - this is normally where you’d drop Garlic to obtain the <strong>Silk Bag</strong>.</p>
<p>There are bouncing blob enemies in this area. You want to lure one all the way to the left of the area, where there is a dead-end. The objective is to jump in the air and get hit by the bouncing blob - and if you do so at just the right height, you’ll be knocked backwards and up onto the dead-end ledge that normally cannot be accessed. Once you’re on this upper ledge, you can walk off the left side of the screen and back to the right, completing the Wrong Warp and ending up at <strong>Laruba Mansion</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You also need to whip while in the air, as this gives Simon the extra pixel he needs to complete the height boost.</li>
<li>Just getting hit by the blob is not enough - it needs to jump at just the right height, and hit Simon at the peak of his jump. Again - lots of factors are involved in this trick!</li>
<li>This will take you several tries. If you die, you can simply walk back to the right to generate a new blob and draw him back to the ledge.</li>
<li>Still stumped? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC08NExogLo">This YouTube video</a> shows the trick in action if you need some context.</li>
<li>While a novel trick, you won’t need to repeat it for any of the other achievements in this set. You could potentially use it to get to Laruba Mansion quickly while attempting <a href="#54231">5-4-2-3-1 We’re Having Fun</a>, but it’s not required.</li>

<em>Get the Morning Star as your 1st item (no other whips, no Dracula parts, nothing else)</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>It’s recommended that you do this achievement separately from the others since you may take a lot of deaths. There are two separate parts to this achievement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get from the Town of Jova to the Town of Ondol.</li>
<li>Get 200 hearts to purchase the Morning Star.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the beginning of the game, you’ll need to head left through the Belasco Marsh, cross the river via ferry (no Heart needed), through the town of Alba, continue on past the Sadam Woods, until you finally reach the town of Ondol! Don’t worry about dying as you’ll likely succumb to your wounds more than a few times. Try to cross the Marsh during the day to reduce the amount of hits the marsh monsters take.</p>
<p>Once you get to Ondol, you can continue left to the Jam Wasteland. The flying ghost enemies are relatively easy to kill and drop a large number of hearts. Grind your way to 200 hearts easily by using the Ondol/Wasteland screen transition. Head back to Ondol, and buy your Morning Star for the unlock.</p>

<a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/218216">That Lizardman Grind (10)</a><br>
<em>Have 120 or more hearts before the first nightfall.</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>The premise of this achievement is that you have an extremely limited amount of time to procure 120 hearts - you start with 50, so you need 70. This seems almost impossible at first glance. When the game first starts, jump down and head left into the Belasco Marsh. I believe the <em>intention</em> of this achievement is to kill these two Lizardmen over and over again, but there’s another place that works a little better.</p>
<p>Keep working your way to the left - jump over the Lizardmen but always try to maintain movement to the left, even if you get hit. You should end up with a very small amount of hit points left when you get to the energy-depleting purple marsh. Go ahead and take a death here.</p>
<p>When you respawn, cross the marsh. You can stop and whip the marsh men. After crossing, the screen transition to the lake will put you in front of two Lizardmen on a slightly elevated ledge. They can’t hurt you with their fireballs here. Kill the two Lizardmen, collect the hearts they drop, and use the screen transition here to generate more!</p>
<p>You may need to try this a few times depending on how lucky you are with heart drops. Each drop is worth 4 hearts, so you need 18 drops before the sun sets to make up the 70 hearts you need to unlock the achievement. If you go a few rounds and the Lizardmen consistently drop nothing, reset the game and try again!</p>

<em>Defeat Carmilla using only the Leather Whip (no item use!)</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>It’s recommended that you accomplish this task during an attempt at <a href="#minimalist">Minimalist Law Abider</a> as they require the same whip usage. Doing this task more than once is time-consuming and a little maddening.</p>
<p>Carmilla is a menacing boss at first, but she actually only has two very predictable phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drops of blood from her eye fall onto the floor, scattering into a spray of fireballs.</li>
<li>She will make circles in the air clockwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>This achievement asks you to kill her with a leather whip with no other item use, however equipping <strong>Dracula’s Rib</strong> is allowed. From the left side of Carmilla, if you’re standing on the fifth block from the entrance, your shield from Dracula’s Rib will block all fireball attacks. You can stand here forever and never be hurt.</p>
<p>From this vantage, you can hit Carmilla with the Leather Whip (multiple times, in some cases) as she completes her clockwise circles with absolutely no danger to you.</p>
<p>The bummer on this achievement is that Carmilla takes <em>a couple hundred lashes</em> of the Leather Whip to destroy - so really the toughest part of this achievement is the patience required to gut it out. Expect to drop five to ten minutes whipping her down.</p>

<p>The timer is set - 3 in game days must pass, which is equal to approximately 18 real time minutes. Remember that inside the house, you won’t actually see day or night transitions and the in-game clock won’t move, but the achievement timer <strong>is running</strong> so it’s just a matter of being patient. It’s suggested that you set your emulator to run at an accelerated speed to make this go quicker! If you don’t, grab a snack or read a book or something as the time harmlessly passes by.</p>

<em>Complete Berkeley Mansion without taking damage or using laurels. Enter, collect body part, leave.</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>The goal of this achievement is to not get hit by anything. In addition, use of Laurels, which grant Simon invincibility, are not allowed. Anything else goes!</p>
<p>Berkeley Mansion is the first mansion you tackle in a normal playthrough of the game, and  completing this without getting hit is not very difficult. There are a few points at which you’ll want to be extra careful. If you’re feeling apprehensive, go to Veros first and buy the Chain Whip to increase your offense.</p>
<p>If at any time you get hit, you can reset the challenge by exiting and re-entering the mansion, <strong>as long as you have not obtained the Body Part yet.</strong> If you take damage after obtaining the body part, <strong>the achievement is missed and you must reset the game</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the second floor of the first room, there’s a bouncing demon. Killing him isn’t too bad, but it will reappear from the right when you start climbing up to the next floor. Before completing the climb, fall back down to the second floor and whip it before it starts spewing fireballs.</li>
<li>Watch out for the jumping Skeletons that throw bones. When the bones hit the floor, they’ll turn into a fireball that continues to burn for a few moments. It’s very easy to accidentally ignore the flames and take damage!</li>
<li>Be wary of pitfall blocks. There’s one at the top of the mansion, and another right before you get to the Body Part. Neither will hurt you but both will waste your time.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to buy an Oak Stake! Make sure you have the 50 hearts available <em>before</em> you attempt this challenge. If you’re attempting <a href="#marslanding">Flawless Mars Landing</a> next, you may want to grab a second Oak Stake on the way out, which will allow you to skip some difficult jumps later.</li>
<li>Use the second pitfall after obtaining the Rib to drop down. From here it’s basically a straight shot to the left to get back out. Three demons will block your way but can be easily dispatched with a Chain Whip.</li>

</pre><p></p>
<p>The goal of this achievement is to not get hit by anything. In addition, use of Laurels, which grant Simon invincibility, are not allowed. Anything else goes!</p>
<p>Rover Mansion is the second mansion tackled in the classic game order. This achievement is also not terribly difficult in terms of enemies, but there are some scary jumps to make that can be mildly terrifying.</p>
<p>If at any time you get hit, you can reset the challenge by exiting and re-entering the mansion, <strong>as long as you have not obtained the Body Part yet.</strong> If you take damage after obtaining the body part, <strong>the achievement is missed and you must reset the game</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole first section of the mansion can be safely ignored. Keep walking to the right until you get to the jump over a pit of water onto a higher block. Jumps of this nature require perfect timing, and if you miss, you’re dead!</li>
<li>The Oak Stake is beyond a platform with a sliding obstacle to jump over. Navigating the obstacle is not too difficult, but jumping onto the platform itself - in both directions - also requires perfect timing. If you have the hearts, buy a second Oak Stake in Berkeley Mansion to skip this entire part!</li>
<li>The rest of this mansion involves carefully navigating the top landing of many staircases so that you don’t bonk into a skeleton. Take it slow!</li>
<li>One more difficult jump over water gets you safely out of the mansion. As with the previous mansion, watch out for flying bones and the fireballs they leave on the floor!</li>

<em>Complete Braham Mansion without taking damage or using laurels. Enter, collect body part, leave.</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>The goal of this achievement is to not get hit by anything. In addition, use of Laurels, which grant Simon invincibility, are not allowed. Anything else goes!</p>
<p>If at any time you get hit, you can reset the challenge by exiting and re-entering the mansion, <strong>as long as you have not obtained the Body Part yet.</strong> If you take damage after obtaining the body part, <strong>the achievement is missed and you must reset the game</strong>.</p>
<p>Of the five mansions, this one is by far the most difficult to get through without being hit. This mansion has a lot of stairs with enemies on the landings, and Simon is a sitting duck when he’s sluggishly moving up or down staircases. The biggest obstacles will be <strong>Spear Men</strong> and <strong>Demons</strong>.</p>
<p>Room 1 of the way in contains three pain points:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a Spear Man at the top of the first staircase. Try to lure him towards the right wall before going up the stairs. Hopefully he will move slowly for an extended period of time and you can get to the second level before he charges.</li>
<li>There’s a Spear Man at the top of the third staircase. Try to lure him as far to the left as possible before going up the stairs. If he starts to move quickly towards the landing, go back down the staircase and try again.</li>
<li>There’s a Demon at the top of the seventh staircase. This one is tough. When the Demon jumps up, it will go off the screen and freeze in place until you scroll up. Your goal here is to lure the Demon as far to the left as humanly possible, and try to get it to jump off the screen. It will freeze in a position way off to the left, which will give Simon some extra time to climb the stairs. Even with this head start, you may have to quickly dodge a fireball before whipping the Demon as it chases you down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Room 2 of the way in is just a gauntlet of pain:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll see two Demons below you. Use Holy Water or the Sacred Flame from your higher position to take them out.</li>
<li>Another Spear Man will be at the bottom of the first staircase. Try to aim Holy Water or the Sacred Flame while standing midway down the staircase.</li>
<li>In the area near the Oak Stake merchant will be three more Spear Men. Do not drop down carelessly or you’ll be hit. Continue to use the Holy Water or Sacred Flame to attack enemies below your position. After beating the second Spear Man, jump to his platform and move to the right, where you can safely dispatch the third Spear Man below.</li>
<li>The final two staircases have bouncing blobs to contend with. If you can get low enough on the first one and the blob decides to switch to the ceiling, it may harmlessly scroll off the top of the screen. The second one however must be dealt with. Try to line yourself up on the staircase and wait for the blob to switch to the ceiling. If while on the ceiling it jumps towards you, move down the stairs away from it. The goal is to try and let it pass you on the ceiling.</li>
<li>The battle with <strong>Death</strong> shouldn’t be too difficult. Try to <a href="#onehitdeath">beat him with one hit</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve got <strong>Dracula’s Eyeball</strong>, the trip out is just as treacherous:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take your time with the blobs. The top one can be easily scrolled off the screen.</li>
<li>Same tactic as before - Try to lure Spear Men away from staircase landings before ascending. Once you make it to the Oak Stake merchant, you’ll need to execute a glitch to get out of Brahm Mansion.</li>
<li>Trying to get through the room with two Demons at the top of the staircase is nearly impossible to navigate without taking a hit, so the best option is to <strong>skip the room entirely</strong>. Climb the staircase just to the right of the Oak Stake merchant, and from there quickly start jumping to the left. As you do so, you’ll ascend faster than the screen can scroll. Keep hopping until you make it all the way to the leftmost wall. Keep jumping up against the top left corner of the screen and you can magically squeeze through the one-block crack in the wall, which will pop you out on the other side! If this didn’t work for you, go back down to the merchant and try again. You can attempt this as many times as you like!</li>
<li>From here, the way out is mostly going down staircases. Just be aware of where enemies are below you if you decide to jump off a ledge instead of descend a staircase. Use Holy Water or the Sacred Flame from the stairs if you need to dispatch an annoying Spear Man or two.</li>

<em>Complete Bodley Mansion without taking damage or using laurels. Enter, collect body part, leave.</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>The goal of this achievement is to not get hit by anything. In addition, use of Laurels, which grant Simon invincibility, are not allowed. Anything else goes!</p>
<p>If at any time you get hit, you can reset the challenge by exiting and re-entering the mansion, <strong>as long as you have not obtained the Body Part yet.</strong> If you take damage after obtaining the body part, <strong>the achievement is missed and you must reset the game</strong>.</p>
<p>Despite being the fourth mansion, this might be one of the easiest of the five to complete without taking damage. Bring an Oak Stake from <strong>Brahm Mansion</strong> to cut a lot of unnecessary travel time. The merchant in that mansion is much more accessible - you should always do this for all of your runs, regardless of the challenge!</p>
<ul>
<li>As you enter the mansion, walk straight until you get to a wall, then jump through an invisible hole to the other side. Here, the  lower spike path can be traversed by breaking the upper layer of blocks with Holy Water. The spikes pose no threat.</li>
<li>From this point you need only descend two staircases to get to the Body Part. Just retread your previous path to get out of the mansion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole thing can be done in a few minutes, encountering less than ten skeleton enemies. If you have to buy the Oak Stake here, the path is much longer and more dangerous.</p>

<em>Complete Laruba Mansion without taking damage or using laurels. Enter, collect body part, leave.</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>The goal of this achievement is to not get hit by anything. In addition, use of Laurels, which grant Simon invincibility, are not allowed. Anything else goes!</p>
<p>If at any time you get hit, you can reset the challenge by exiting and re-entering the mansion, <strong>as long as you have not obtained the Body Part yet.</strong> If you take damage after obtaining the body part, <strong>the achievement is missed and you must reset the game</strong>.</p>
<p>Laruba is the final mansion to tackle in a straight playthrough of the game. This achievement has a couple sticky situations to be aware of, but beating the whole thing damageless is not terribly difficult.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first room involves a lengthy walk, but there are a lot of Skeletons and Spear Men. As always, keep your eyes on the bones that Skeletons throw, since they burst into a fireball upon hitting the floor, and that fireball tends to linger around longer than you expect.</li>
<li>When you enter the second area you’ll have a choice to go up or down. Go up first until you find the Oak Stake merchant. After you make the purchase, <strong>turn around</strong> and take the lower path instead, which is easier. The upper path has some blind drops that will almost definitely see you taking unavoidable damage.</li>
<li>Jump down to the lowest path. Talk to the man if you want some free Laurels - do <strong>not</strong> talk to him if you’re also engaged in an achievement that doesn’t allow items, like <a href="#minimalist">Minimalist Law Abider</a>, or you’ll invalidate that challenge.</li>
<li>Crossing the spike pit on the two moving platforms requires a little luck. You need to continue forward progress as spiders from the upper path may be slinging webs at you. Also, spikes will generate below the platforms and shoot upwards. Don’t jump around like crazy or you’re more likely to jump right into the spike pit. Adjust your positioning on each platform to dodge the flying spikes and calmly jump from one platform to the next when it’s clear.</li>
<li>Equip Dracula’s Rib and dispatch Carmilla using whatever method you prefer. You can stand on the fifth block from the entrance holding your shield and never be hurt!</li>
<li>On the way out you’ll need to take the much more narrow path above the spike pit, which has spiders. Try to take them out before they shoot webs. Use of the Dagger or Golden Knife is recommended. Once you’re out of that narrow passage and you start heading up, watch out for new webs that might appear behind you!</li>
<li>From this point it’s a straight shot out of the mansion. Always watch for enemies at the bottom of staircases and be extra careful of bone-throwing Skeletons on levels below you. Their bones or fireballs can and will hit you if you’re not paying attention!</li>

<a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/218224">Devo Would Be Proud (50)</a><br>
<em>Beat the game collecting only whips, crystals, oak stakes, magic cross, and dracula’s body parts.</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>For these Low % Challenges, it’s always important to lay out the restrictions and allowances to get a better gauge on how to approach the playthrough.  Here are the restrictions for this achievement:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot collect any subweapons. This leads to some interesting situations, for instance - <strong>you cannot kill Death</strong>, or you’ll obtain the Golden Knife, which negates the achievement.</li>
<li>You cannot buy Laurels. This will impact how you get to Laruba Mansion, which requires crossing a deadly marsh. You may need to beef up your experience level. Consequently, you cannot <strong>receive</strong> Laurels from the old man in Laruba Mansion either! <strong>Do not talk to him!</strong></li>
<li>Without Holy Water, you cannot get some items, like the Chain Whip. It also will force you to accomplish some goals in Rover Mansion and Dracula’s Castle by <a href="#floordrop">questionable means</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that out of the way, here’s what you can do to make this achievement a little easier.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can upgrade your whip however you see fit. Even without Holy Water, the Morning Star is obtainable in the town of Ondol.</li>
<li>Equipping Dracula’s Nail allows you to break blocks with your whip. With it, you can access the old man who upgrades to the Flame Whip, and also continue forward to Laruba Mansion.</li>
<li>Crystals, Oak Stakes, and the Cross are required for game progression.</li>
<li>There are no restrictions to your experience level. You can grind away to Level 6 if you desire!</li>
</ul>
<p>With all of the points noted above, this achievement is not terribly hard, since you can easily govern your damage output by <a href="#whipdamage">upgrading your whip</a> and your defense through experience level.</p>
<p>There are two tricky parts in this challenge that absolutely require <a href="#floordrop">Floor Drops</a> to continue, since your lack of Holy Water will prevent forward progress.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rover Mansion</strong> - Bring an extra Oak Stake from Brahm Mansion since you won’t be able to get one here without Holy Water. You will eventually reach a point where you’ll hit a dead end and will also be unable to return. There is a spot where you can perform a Floor Drop to pass the obstruction and continue to the Body Part. This is Dracula’s Nail, which helps solve some of the Holy Water restrictions. The way out of the mansion follows a different, unobstructed path.</li>
<li><strong>Dracula’s Castle</strong> - Near the beginning, there’s a spot where you’d normally use Holy Water to break blocks at your feet, but you have no Holy Water and the Nail won’t help you break blocks below you. If you use the Nail to break the first two blocks, you can create a clear vertical path to the stairs below. Floor Drop through the breakable blocks and land directly on the stairs. Press down to descend the stairs and continue onwards!</li>

<a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/218225">Minimalist Law Abider (50)</a><br>
<em>Beat the game with the leather whip, collecting only the holy water, crystals, oak stakes, magic cross, and Dracula’s body parts.</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>For these Low % Challenges, it’s always important to lay out the restrictions and allowances to get a better gauge on how to approach the playthrough.  Here are the restrictions for this achievement:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot upgrade your whip. Purchasing the Thorn Whip, Chain Whip, or Morning Star is prohibited! Without the Morning Star, you cannot upgrade to the Flame Whip either.</li>
<li>With the exception of the Holy Water, no other subweapons can be obtained. You also cannot kill <strong>Death</strong> or he will drop the Golden Knife.</li>
<li>This includes Laurels - There is a man in Laruba Mansion who will give you Laurels just for talking to him. <strong>Do not talk to him!</strong></li>
<li>Oak Stakes can be bought for the sole purpose of obtaining Dracula’s Body Parts.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, there are still a few very important allowances to help you unlock this achievement:</p>
<ul>
<li>You get Holy Water, which allows you to break blocks and avoid having to do <a href="#floordrop">Floor Drops</a>. Additionally, the Holy Water can take full advantage of the <a href="#maxdamage">Maximum Damage</a> glitch, which will probably be very important at the end of the game.</li>
<li>You can still level up to your heart’s content. Pushing to Level 5 or 6 will help you survive the final battle. Additionally, dying and continuing are also allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the stakes decided, this challenge is more annoying than it is difficult. Enemies take tons of hits with the leather whip by the time you get to Bodley Mansion, and collecting enough hearts to buy Oak Stakes can be painful. Killing Carmilla with the Leather Whip takes a couple hundred hits and a lot of time, but will also unlock <a href="#carmilla">Stop Your Cryin’</a>. The final battle with Dracula is the most challenging fight in this run. Here’s your strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Come into the battle on a high level, 5 or 6, to increase your defense.</li>
<li>Dracula takes too many hits to rely on your Leather Whip alone. Get to the bottom left corner and equip your <strong>Holy Water</strong> instead.</li>
<li>Try to use your whip to destroy projectiles. Duck under some if you can. It’s hard to gauge the projectile hit boxes but it’s somewhere inside the spinning pattern. Don’t attempt to step forward from the corner or Dracula will hit you.</li>
<li>Spam the heck out of your Holy Water as Dracula spins around the room. What you’re hoping for here is an <strong>accidental execution</strong> of the <a href="#maxdamage">Maximum Damage Glitch</a>, which will happen if the Holy Water hits Dracula the frame before the Holy Water disappears from hitting the floor. This will register <strong>255 damage</strong> to Dracula and almost certainly defeat him immediately.</li>
<li>If you don’t get the glitch to go off and you die, that’s okay. There’s no penalty and you can approach Dracula to try again. Holy Water doesn’t use hearts as ammunition. Keep trying until you get a lucky throw!</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/218226">Inexperienced (25)</a><br>
<em>Beat the game without gaining any experience levels.</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>For these Low % Challenges, it’s always important to lay out the restrictions and allowances to get a better gauge on how to approach the playthrough.  Here are the restrictions for this achievement:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot gain any levels - when Dracula is defeated you must still be on Level 0. Your experience must never cross the boundary of 100 points or you’ll hit Level 1, and the achievement will be missed. Your defense and hit points will remain in a very sad state.</li>
<li>The amount of Hearts you can have is also severely reduced, since the only way to get hearts (besides the allowance of 50 you receive to start the game) is to kill enemies, which in turn, give experience.</li>
<li>It is technically <em>possible</em> to get the Morning Star by farming hearts on the first few screens. You then need to bring your 200 Hearts to Ondol without continuing, since hitting a Game Over state will reset your hearts to zero. This is pretty difficult and not really worth it - most players will cap out on this run with the Chain Whip, and that’s good enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these restrictions in place, let’s now look at what you <strong>can</strong> do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Die, as much as you want. This is a very important distinction since hitting Game Over and selecting Continue will set your experience points back to zero. Any time you make an important purchase or notice your experience points approaching 100, you should intentionally Game Over.</li>
<li>Beyond issues with obtaining a Morning Star and by association the Flame Whip, every other item in the game can be obtained by normal means. This includes Laurels, which provide invincibility upon use.</li>
</ul>
<p>With all of these points noted, this achievement becomes Simon plodding forward slowly, meeting his demise frequently. As you collect hearts for each incremental purchase, take intentional deaths to reset the experience points you gain along the way.</p>
<p>Check your experience levels from time to time and reset them with some well placed jumps into the lake! Collect about 50 hearts for the final battle with Dracula and you can still kill him the same way as normal, by stun-locking him with a Golden Knife.</p>

<a href="https://retroachievements.org/achievement/218227">I Left My Whip in My Other Pants (100)</a><br>
<em>Beat the game: No whipping allowed! But you can use other weapons such as holy water and knife. Whip animation from using the laurels is allowed.</em><br>
</pre><p></p>
<p>Here we go - this is the big one! You get a cool 100 achievement points if you can finish the whole game without ever whipping. This is a deceptively difficult task, as any seasoned Belmont knows there are tons of other weapons to use, however the true sinister evil of this achievement has more to do with the technical limitations of the game. Get ready for a doozy - here are just some of the many ways this achievement can go sideways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s important to understand how the game prioritizes attack objects. If you throw Holy Water or a Dagger and attempt to throw another too soon, the game will make you whip instead, even if you’re holding Up on the D-Pad. Because of this, spamming the attack button is highly discouraged! Be deliberate with your attacks, and try to wait for your first shot to disappear before throwing another one.</li>
<li>Even though you’re not allowed to whip, buying better whips is highly encouraged! Because of the way <a href="#whipdamage">Whip Damage Calculations</a> work, your subweapons work better when you have a better whip. Upgrade to the Flame Whip if you can - even if you never use it.</li>
<li>Be careful whenever you talk to characters, such as merchants or crystal traders. The Talk button is the same as the Whip button, and if the person you’re talking to surprisingly turns around just before you’re about to talk, you’ll whip instead.</li>
<li>Trying to attack anything while standing on stairs is extremely discouraged. The game tends to have trouble determining if you’re pressing Up to shoot a subweapon or to travel up stairs. This is more than likely to cause you to accidentally whip.</li>
<li>After you switch to and use an Oak Stake, there will be a moment when you have <strong>no subweapon equipped</strong>. You’ll need to manually switch back to a subweapon right after collecting a Body Part. Make special note of this! If you don’t, the next time you attempt to throw a subweapon, you’ll whip instead.</li>
<li>Similarly, if you intend to use a subweapon that utilizes Hearts as ammunition such as the <strong>Golden Knife</strong>, you need to maintain a heart count. If you try to use a subweapon that requires hearts, and you have zero, you will whip instead. Remeber that your heart count goes to zero every time you continue from a Game Over!</li>
<li><strong>Whipping even once will invalidate the run, even if it happens hours into your attempt. Be careful!!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to avoid an accidental whip is to try to <strong>completely minimize attacking anything at all</strong>. Once you get to a stable point, try jumping over or avoiding enemies instead. <strong>Dying is perfectly acceptable</strong> in this goal, so just run for it whenever you can. There are some times where you’ll need to stop and grind for hearts or experience, and you’ll want to do so in a predictable environment.</p>
<p>Here are some pointers for getting going:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your first 50 Hearts to buy the <strong>Holy Water</strong>. This will be your only weapon for a little while. Holy Water uses zero Hearts so you have unlimited use.</li>
<li>Travel to the town of Veros. Along the way, use your Holy Water to kill skeletons and raise 50 more Hearts to buy a <strong>Dagger</strong>. The Dagger is going to be your primary attack method for almost the entire game, so get used to using it! It also does not consume Hearts on use.</li>
<li>You’ll have to backtrack, collect 50 more Hearts, and buy the <strong>White Crystal</strong>. These first three purchases are time consuming but necessary to get started.</li>
<li>You can spend some early time grinding hearts and experience. Get 100 Hearts to buy an Oak Stake on the way into <strong>Berkeley Mansion</strong>, and potentially the way out as well.</li>
<li>Grab the <strong>Sacred Flame</strong> if you want it, otherwise trade for the <strong>Blue Crystal</strong> and head to Rover Mansion.</li>
<li>As you head towards <strong>Brahm Mansion</strong> you can try to level up using the Lizardmen. There are several safe places to do this. It is always recommended to buy a second Oak Stake on the way out of Brahm Mansion. Don’t forget to <a href="onehitdeath">kill Death with your Dagger</a> to score the <strong>Golden Knife</strong>!</li>
<li>Trade for the <strong>Red Crystal</strong>, and if you’re up to it, grind 200 Hearts in the Sadam Woods to buy the Morning Star in Ondol. <strong>Bodley Mansion</strong> should be a piece of cake as long as you brought an Oak Stake with you from the previous mansion. Afterwards, you’ll likely be in a sore spot for hearts, or experience, or both.</li>
<li>Upgrade to the Flame Whip on the way to <strong>Laruba Mansion</strong>. You can use Laurels to cross the marsh, but even on Level 3, crossing with some well-timed jumping is possible.</li>
<li>You need 50 hearts to buy one more Oak Stake in Laruba Mansion. You may need to grind it out inside the mansion. The skeletons here take 15 Dagger hits to destroy. This will test your patience. Use the Golden Knife to beat Carmilla - the <strong>Cross</strong> is required to beat the game! Make sure you have hearts left over from the Oak Stake purchase so you have the necessary ammunition to beat her.</li>
<li>Before going into <strong>Dracula’s Castle</strong>, grind another 50 or so hearts in the Vrad Graveyard killing mummies. You can use this for ammunition in the Dracula fight. You can still stun lock him with the Golden Knife, just be patient with your throws.</li>
<li><strong>Good luck!</strong> If you accidentally whip, reset the game, take a short walk to calm down, and give it another go!</li>
